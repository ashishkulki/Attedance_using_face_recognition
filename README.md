# Attedance_using_face_recognition
There are lots of colleges and schools in which thousands of students are taking education. To maintain the attendance and records of these so many numbers of students is a very difficult task . Therefore , we can implement an effective system which will mark the attendance of students automatically by recognizing their faces.  A database will be useful for comparison purpose. By enrolling the students to the database, we can maintain the information of the students like roll number, student's name, and his or her photo for identification. 
Firstly,to mark the attendance of students, we require database of students.A database will be useful for comparison purpose.Hence in database generation phase, images of students along with their names and other details like roll numbers can be added.
After the database generation is completed, these captured images need to be trained. In training phase, the captured images will be converted into grayscale format along with their haar features like eyes,facial expressions,nose etc.
The final phase is Detection phase where the comparison of captured image and database is performed and attendance report is generated in excel sheet format.
